# ReactJS Coding Challenge

The main goal of this challenge is to get a sense of your coding style and choices. Please assume that this code will go to production, so apply any relevant engineering practices.

The code challenge does not involve any exotic or bleeding-edge technologies, tools, etc. and that’s the point: We’d like to focus on your code style and not get distracted.

There are no "right" or "wrongs", all we want to see is how you like to code. It's not necessary to do everything listed in the task but please provide enough code so that we are able to understand your current abilities.

Treat the challenge as a guideline, you're welcome to customise it but please provide some explanation why.

That also allows us to have a more fruitful and constructive discussion at the technical interview. We’re not fans of white-boarding at interviews, so we’d much rather have some concrete code to talk about. We think that makes the interview much more enjoyable and productive.

There are a lot of elements in the design so it's not necessary to finish the whole thing, what is important is to see how you work and how you break it down.
